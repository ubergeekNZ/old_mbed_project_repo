# It's best to hide all the details of setting up the variable SRCS in a CMake
# macro. The macro can then be called in all the project CMake list files to add
# sources.
#
# The macro first computes the path of the source file relative to the project
# root for each argument. If the macro is invoked from inside a project sub
# directory the new value of the variable SRCS needs to be propagated to the
# parent folder by using the PARENT_SCOPE option.
